A simple implementation for the GDAS paper : [Searching for A Robust Neural Architecture in Four GPU Hours](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04465)

TODO:
1. Currently the search code is running without issues except for extreme memory usage, but I still need to double-check the search training process and then only investigate the final architecture found using GDAS
