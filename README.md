A simple implementation for the GDAS paper : [Searching for A Robust Neural Architecture in Four GPU Hours](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04465)

Note: The coding is still a work-in-progress and is still under development

TODO:
1. I still need to double-check the search training process and then only investigate the final architecture found using GDAS
